# NotABackdoor

<h3><u>This is not a backdoor!</u></h3>The name might be a bit sus, but I am trying to make it as secure as possible.<br>
This is a paper minecraft plugin that will contain all 'modules' and a webserver in one, and will also be more secure than the previous 'NotABackdoor' repo's.<br>
<h1>This is a work on progress, and is not finished!</h1>
